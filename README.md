# StreetViewDownloader

Web app that allows you to download and view google street view panoramas

### Reason for creation
According to an [announcement by google](https://blog.google/intl/de-de/produkte/suchen-entdecken/google-street-view-aktualisierung-deutschland/), they will be updating their street view images in Germany in mid July 2023. However, the old images from 2008/2009 will be deleted. I wanted to make it possible to download some panoramas before they are gone forever.
